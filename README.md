------------------------------------------------------------

You probably don't remember me, but my name is Alon Carmel,
I'm the co-founder of a lost startup called Devunity.

Back in 2007 we launched a very cool startup called Devunity which promised to be the best and first online web only IDE, We launched at techcrunch 50 on stage, got grilled, had a great ride, succedded enormously and failed miserably. Eventually we closed down the project after loosing the faith in the idea of having a proper responsive and fast online IDE that people can use. It was just too early.

Times have changed since, Technologies evolved and new opportunities came too.

During all that time i kept our loyal registered Devunity developers on my hard drive without any use until today.
You are receiving this email hopefully a start of a new newsletter and community of developers eager to stay at the bleeding edge of technology.

For quite some time i've been curating and managing 3 successful Flipboard magazines:
* Technophobia (http://flip.it/PmMDS) with 80,000 readers.
* Codephobia (http://flip.it/68vFI) with 14,000 readers.
* Designophobia (http://flip.it/At4Hp) with 1500 readers.

All of them none spammy, advertisement free magazines which i curate with the best content served daily.
Since i've been collecting so much content everyday (around 15 articles per magazine every morning)


i've decided to push ahead and start a newsletter called Codephobia.
------------------------------------------------------------
Codephobia will curate the best content i can find around technology, code and usability, best articles, code examples and cutting edge technologies in the market.

My pledge for this magazine is:
1. No spam
I will not spam you with advertisement, sell your email to 3rd party or try to convince you that im a lost prince looking to invest his fathers fortune.

2. Related only
Only content around technology, code and ux. Anything kitten related is out. well... maybe just one.

3. Bi-Weekly
Sent once every two weeks, it will consist of great articles, links and curated content, No more no less.

4. Open sourced
If you wish to contribute to this magazine, we are all open source, The newsletter will also be published freely on github as an opensource repo (https://github.com/aloncarmel/codephobia) . If you wish to add your own content
(Pending editorial for the newsletter) you can just pull the newsletter and push your content. Its easy :)


All I'm asking is to give me a chance and i'll give back your faith in newsletters and humanity.

Thank you for your time.

Cheers
Alon Carmel
